# Risk_Management

Welcome to my Risk Management Journey repository! This repository documents my learning process and practical application of risk management concepts, starting with credit risk management and focusing on measuring expected loss through the development of three models: **Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD)**.
